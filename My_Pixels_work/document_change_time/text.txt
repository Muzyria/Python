ER: Device can download/install OS/APK/GPS updates even if the device is not connected to cart/receiving power from cable  - *Confirmed*

*C) GPS update queued – but then removed*
- For these cases, we need to also consider if a device is off when an update is queued
ER: If the device downloaded update files successfully, the device proceeds to install downloaded files next time it wakes up from tablet sync/power cycles *Confirmed*
If the device did NOT download files successfully, the device does not reattempt to download files once the update queue is removed from the Control *Confirmed*
- For these cases, we need to also consider if a device is off when an update is queued - (CBS)- *Confirmed*

*D) GPS update queued – then updated to a different version*  *%{background:yellow} Skiped (There is no other version)%*
- For these cases, we need to also consider if a device is off when an update is queued
ER: If previous update files did not download successfully/completely, the tablet will see a new updated version available and will download the updated version queued -

If updated files DID download successfully, the device will check and compare different/new updated versions that are available and will download new OS/APK/GPS update files available (NOT INSTALL previously downloaded files).

*E) OS/APK/GPS update queued – files downloaded, update still queued* - *Confirmed*
- For these cases we need to also consider if a device is off when update is queued
ER: Device checks if any new updates are queued *Confirmed*
If files downloaded = the same update that is currently queued, device installs files upon tablet sync/power cycle.
If files downloaded are DIFFERENT than update version that is queued - see logic for Case F (downloads new files instead) - *Confirmed*

*F) OS/APK/GPS update queued – files installed, update still queued*  - *Confirmed*
ER: Device checks if any new updates are queued *Confirmed*
If files installed = the same update that is currently queued, nothing occurs
If files installed are DIFFERENT than update version that is queued - see logic for Case F (downloads new files )

*G) Download/Install of APK/OS/GPS in process, then app crashes*
ER: App will be able to load correctly, and upon recovering that app will attempt to re-download the queued update the next time to goes through tablet sync, power up, falling asleep). (Full Up)
