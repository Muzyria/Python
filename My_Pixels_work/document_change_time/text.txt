*E) OS/APK/GPS update queued – files downloaded, update still queued* - *Confirmed*
- For these cases we need to also consider if a device is off when update is queued
ER: Device checks if any new updates are queued *Confirmed*
If files downloaded = the same update that is currently queued, device installs files upon tablet sync/power cycle.
